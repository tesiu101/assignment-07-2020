Assignment Information:

How to start:
make sure you have node.js installed
open command window in the the folder containig package.json
run npm install
run npm test <- to run tests
run npm start <- to start the app - will be hosted on http://localhost:5000/

Info:
I know that the solution I present is not the exact solution expected by the by the assignment. 
This is a example project where the component described in the assignment (I named ExTable -> Example Table) is a part of an app not a separate library/package. 
I didn't managed to create it as a separate library. I have little to no experience in creating external package I only created component as a part of an app,
and my free time was not enough to set it up as specified in the assignment. 

My process:
I tried the project via create-react-library, but problems with imports in example project created by the script (I assume due to sim-links no working ok on Windows - but could have been also other problems). 
Pressed by time I decided to rollback and just create a simple project where the the component would be embedded so the assignment would be fulfilled in some way.

What went not quite right:
- Component is a build in component of an application not an ready to use external one. 
- I had problems with scss loader, so i moved all the styles to  the template file. Sill works but its not an optimal solution. (I assume some small problem but I didn't find it at the time, so I proceed with solution that is working)


What went well:
- The component works fine like in the specs
- test coverage of the component and reducer
- uses a simple reducer to handle data 

Notes:
- using redux for state for this small component is a bit overkill in my opinion, local useState's would be sufficient in my opinion
- actions use a different naming convention than the rest of the project (using '_' as separation not camel case), this is to difference them from the rest of the project especially form connect 
actions so it's easier to navigate and know what scope we are in at the moment
